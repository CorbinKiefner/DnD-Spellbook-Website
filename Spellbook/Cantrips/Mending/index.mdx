description: "This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, 
such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking 
wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, 
you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell 
canâ€™t restore magic to such an object."
