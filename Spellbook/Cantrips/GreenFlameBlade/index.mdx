attack’s normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different 
creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire 
damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier."

spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) 
and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8)."
