description: "You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on 
one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw,
or it takes 1d6 poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its 
speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. 
This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, 
the target doesn't move."
