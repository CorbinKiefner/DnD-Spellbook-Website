description: "You point your finger toward a creature within range 
and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the 
message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar 
with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 
1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 
feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesnâ€™t have to follow a straight 
line and can travel freely around corners or through openings."
