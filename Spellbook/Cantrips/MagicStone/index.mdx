description: "You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. 
You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles 
by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. 
If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability 
modifier, not the attackerâ€™s, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning 
damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell 
then ends on the stone.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it."
