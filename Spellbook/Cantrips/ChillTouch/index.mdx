description: "You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged 
spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 
1d8 necrotic damage, and it canâ€™t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the 
hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls 
against you until the end of your next turn."
