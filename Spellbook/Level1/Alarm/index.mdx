description: "You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an 
area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm 
alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you 
cast the spell, you can designate creatures that wonâ€™t set off the alarm. You also choose 
whether the alarm is mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind 
if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. 
An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet."
